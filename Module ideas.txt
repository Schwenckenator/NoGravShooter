Default Passive Ability:
Radar/Sonar/Motion Detector
shows location of other players
display is relative to players 'upwards' direction (eg if an enemy is ahead of the player that enemies icon will display above the players icon)
the size of an enemies icon is defined by their 'height' relative to the player
enemies above the player will have larger icons, while enemies below will have smaller icons
the icons will be somewhat transparent to account for overlaps


1 Module may be equipped as an active, 2 modules may be equipped as passives
the module equipped as an active cannot be equipped as a passive
all active modules need a cool-down/warm-up time


Module1:
Active: Dash/Blink/Short range teleport
player instantly rushes forwards a set distance, regardless of current speed & direction
after use speed & direction would return to the what they were before use
module would detect if anything solid is in front of the player and cut the distance so the player stops just before the object

Passive: Movement Speed/Acceleration
player walks faster
player can speed up and change direction faster when floating


Module2:
Active: Invulnerability/Invincibility
temporarily become unable to take damage

Passive: More Health/Stronger
player has more health/stronger armour and takes more damage to kill
a bit more mass so a little slower at walking and accelerating/changing direction when floating
(equipping module1 as another passive can cancel out the slowness)


Module3:
Active: Invisibility/Cloaking
temporarily become invisible
also not show up on radar?
perhaps not completely invisible, just mostly, so people still have a chance to notice

Passive: scan-proof
player is not shown on enemy radars while standing/walking (campers yolo420swagMLGpro)


Module4:
Active: Weapon Recharge
player uses suit power to recharge energy weapon
temporarily disables flight controls
doesnt work if a slug weapon is equipped
gives the weapon an extra ammo with amount depending on weapon type
(eg laserrifle gets 30, shock-cannon gets 12, plasma blaster gets 4)

Passive: Gradual Charge
equipped energy weapons gradually gain ammo over time
(relative to clip size, so you arent gonna get 1 plasma blast in the same amount of time as 1 laser rifle shot)


Module5:
Active: Energy Pulse
effectively a force-cannon blast except its a sphere expanding around the player
has slightly less 'push' as force-cannon and does much less damage

Passive: Energy Shield
player takes less damage from energy weapons

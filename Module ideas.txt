1 Module may be equipped as an active, 2 modules may be equipped as passives
the module equipped as an active cannot be equipped as a passive
All active modules need a cool-down/warm-up time
ALL features of an active module are temporary


Module1:
Active: Dash
player instantly rushes forwards a set distance, regardless of current speed & direction
after use speed/momentum/direction would return to the what they were before use
(module would detect if anything solid is in front of the player and cut the distance short
that way the player stops just before the object and cant go phasing through walls)

Passive: Speed Boost
player walks faster
player accelerates/decelerates faster when floating


Module2:
Active: Invulnerability
temporarily become unable to take damage

Passive: Strength Boost
player has more health/stronger armour and therefore takes more damage to kill
a bit more mass so a little slower at walking and accelerating/decelerating when floating
(equipping module1 as another passive cancels out the difference resulting in default speeed)


Module3:
Active: Invisibility
temporarily become invisible and not show on enemy players radars
(perhaps not completely invisible, maybe like 90% transparent, so people still have a chance to notice)

Passive: Radar-Proof
player is not shown on enemy radars while standing/walking
(campers yolo420swagMLGpro)


Module4:
Active: Weapon Recharge
player uses suit power to recharge energy weapon
temporarily disables flight controls
doesnt work if a slug weapon is equipped
gives the weapon an extra ammo with amount depending on weapon type
(eg laserrifle gets 30, shock-cannon gets 12, plasma blaster gets 4, basically one 'clip')

Passive: Gradual Charge
equipped energy weapons gradually gain ammo over time
(relative to 'clip' size, so you arent gonna get 1 plasma blast in the same amount of time as 1 laser rifle shot)


Module5:
Active: Energy Pulse
effectively a force-cannon blast except its a sphere expanding around the player
has slightly less 'push' as force-cannon and does less damage

Passive: Energy Shield
player takes less damage from energy weapons


Module6:
Active: Scanner
Radar decetion distance doubles
Any player that appears on radar but cant be seen is given a coloured overlay/silhouette that goes 'above' everything
(like nametags used to)
this allows you to 'see' players through walls
invisible players will also be given an overlay if they are in line of sight

Passive: Radar Boost
Radar detection distance * 1.5
